## Starting anew

Years ago I bought a domain sebhong.com and I used the classic HTML, CSS and JavaScript combo to build the website. 
Over time, there is no shortage of web tech stacks to choose from. JAMstack caught my eye but I wanted more control
over how my website will behave â€” not to mention opaque hosting price. So here I am using GitHub Pages and it is generous enough
for now.
